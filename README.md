# MMOP_FSCD
In the proposed algorithm, a fine-grained special crowding distance (FSCD) is used to measure the comprehensive crowding distance of individuals in the decision and objective spaces. Next, the FSCD-based reproduction strategy is employed to select the exemplar and generate high-qualify offspring. Finally, the environmental selection based on dual-space is proposed to improve the convergence of the population without deteriorating its diversity. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, a series of experiments are carried out against CEC2019 benchmark problems. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm is superior to peer competitors.
